This will redirect you to a Discord oauth link which should auto login to DBots, with your currently logged-in Discord account.
After logging into the dashboard, you can [add a bot](/dashboard/bots/new) by clicking on the '+' icon.

## Step 3
**Fill in the Form and Post**
Fill in the form and post.
Your bot has now been added to the approval queue!
